### Q. How to pronouce 'Jun Xiong' in Chinese?
A. It sounds like 'Dream Ceon'. I can say it is 80% close to the origin Chinese pronouciation.

Another way is using my github id:  sure-dream. It is fair close. But doesn't make sure because dream should be unsure, which is the attractive.

My daughter name is Sophia. has to accept her last name. She thinks it is funny to have the most difficult last name in the class.

I read an research paper talking about 

```javascript
var n = 100;
for(var i=0; i < n; i++) {
	for(var j=0; j < n; i++) {
		for(var k=0; k < n; i++) {
		}
	}
}

```
