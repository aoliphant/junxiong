I have participated in the interview both in China and U.S, mainly the programmer, internship students, but also research colleagues, I am not the interviewer who has the last word, just the boss usually too busy. I needed to arrange the interview, collect information and ‘establish’ opinion, and then the boss appeared, talked with the visitor about five to ten minutes, and finally discuss the finalists.  So this article is not a professional opinion but just my personal thoughts.

If we put an interview as a project, one way to evaluate the goal is "efficiency", did we do a good job to collect accurate information, understand visitor’s situation, and make the right decision; the other way is "experience", whether we finish a pleasant contact with each other, not embarrassment and dishonor.  Although we have a few of different targets, the purpose of the procedure is to solve the following three questions:

1. Can the guy get the job done?
1. Is he get along well with the team?
1. What is the ‘cost’ to do the #1 and #2 if I am the people to help him get involved?

"Can the guy get the job done?" For an interviewer with technical background, it is easy to have an unrealistic metamorphosis, and finally become difficult for the interviewer.  For example, my first time to interview people is exactly what I just described: it almost happened 12 years ago, my group needs an intern. I was informed to participate as a technical interviewer. I was only twenty-five and was very excited. I immediately prepared THREE groups of questions list: the first one contains basic, commonly questions, then followed by in-depth ones, and then I even listed out some questions I don’t have satisfying answers too. Of course, it turned out to be a very tough testing. When it finished, my colleague told me the question was too hard. That was true. I had to admit that if I were the interviewee,  even I could not pass that kind of testing.  It was entirely from the interviewer, rather than for the candidates, simply can not achieve the purpose.

"Is this person able to work on the team?" This is an evaluation about how the candidate can get along with the co-workers.  In the procedure of interview,  the candidate is just speaking and expressing himself. And you need to tell how he perform/act in reality. Bias will be there. But you can always get some information for reference if you can find good questions. For example,  you provide some information, and check the quality of his response, would he like to provide some responsible information with clarity? Or just some general stuff which is hard to tell useful or not?

"What is the ‘cost’?” means we want to do a more accurate assessment. Everything comes with its cost: time, money, opportunity management. If it is too hard to coordinate work with somebody, you can not even protect yourself. Also, you need to think about how to work with this candidate, can he work independently from scratch, or need more guidance and instruction? Again, everything comes with its cost.

And the rest are ‘HR questions’: long-term plan, honest, productivity, etc. This relies on you have a lot of experience to read people.  I don’t have.

And the next is the interview process.  In China it used to be like following:

1. Interviewers holding the resume of candidate, asking him to start his self-introduction, or the candidate has the opportunities to present a 15-minutes slides show;
1. Ask and answer, in the end interviewee gets the turn to ask his questions;
1. Coding/operating on a computer;
1. HR people comes to help the candidate to fill some psychological questionnaire;

I did have too much influence to this procedure when I was in China, in other words, I was regarded as "technical support" for HR department. In my opinion, this process is also from the perspective of the recruiter easy to operate. However, I don’t think people’s ability can be evaluated fairly through such processes. I would like to start in a more relaxed atmosphere to get the natural and real aspects of the candidates beyond the resumes and emails.  If it takes me 20-minutes but I still can’t get deeper than the surface impression, I will question the communication between the candidates and me. I will consider it is the failure of my job, not candidates’. 

A resume represents the candidate’s ‘self-vision’ and the efforts to take a chance. My job is not to investigate where his experience statement is ‘reliable’ or ‘credible,' but to answer a series of my questions:  did he achieve something on his own? Or just a ‘free rider’ in a group? Does he can stick to specific details and try to integrate it into a bigger picture?  Does he have the responsibility to make sure he convey useful things to other people? These are really important questions rather than some ‘exaggerated highlight’ in the resume. In fact, technical ability and project experience can be very easily verified nowadays. I won’t ask a person a python/R question to test whether he really can remember a command or function. I just encourage him to evaluate himself: how you describe your level of X language/tools. Then, open your GitHub page, do some brief introduction or presentation. Almost everything you have done, you are doing, is traced by technology. 

A distinction exists between the “surface" knowledge and"essence" knowledge; it depends on the time you invest on the understanding of the important concepts.  Your understanding can be different from me in a good way, but not just list out some popular vocabulary. You never heard some specific term; it is totally fine. But don’t give me specious, plausible inputs. Don’t leave me an impression that you doesn’t care too much about what you just tell. If you learn a lot of things, experience a lot of projects, but you don’t care too much about the consistency within your own knowledgeable. It will be a really bad thing, which means probably when you move to new stuff, your abilities to transfers from ‘theory’ into ‘action’  would be very weaker. You seems to be ‘fast learner’ but will end as an ‘aimless talker.'

I ask people to talk about themselves, just occasionally intervene serving for the different purposes.  Sometimes I express consent and encouragement, and some to confirm his level of practice, some are about the depth and breadth of his knowledge.  In this process, every word he speaks is to provide testimony for his actual communication skills.

In the Internet age seeking the answer to a well-defined question is already resolved (might not for some people), so the rest problem should be how to manage and get the insights from so much information. I am always wondering why people still hesitate to introduce some revolutionary changes in the forms of the interview?

In fact, the higher level the job seeker is, the richer experience he has, the more he tend to use his social network to find the next job.  In this process, all the exchange of information is often through a dinner talk. Since it can make people more relax and more efficient to exchange crucial information. So why not do the same things in the interview?  From the interviewer, it requests sense of consciousness, you are the person to start such kind of conversation, so you have the responsibility to make this process more smooth, everyone's mood more comfortable. The candidate is not necessary to meet all your expectations; he just needs to answer your questions fairly to help you determine whether it is worthy to spend more time on him or not. I treat each interviewer in good faith, and they spend their own time to enrich my knowledge.  I am also trying my best to provide them with useful information as a reference.

For the interviewee, I think you should be fair to yourself first: if you feel you didn’t perform as expected, maybe it is not your fault, maybe you just meet a not-so-good interviewer, who not know their duties quite well and don’t realize his responsibility to guide you to perform. But if you can tell the interviewer is friendly, you should take the opportunity to start an effective communication to make most of this experience.
