I am an Asian adult, 36. I have been writing in Chinese for more than thirty years. As a blogger fan(but not a successful one), I post three times a week. I see more than 800 people reading my posts.

But when I write in English, which language I learned more than 20 years, I always feel like a 8-year-old kid. My ideas vanish, my strength disappears, my confidence evaporates.

In fact I think I know the reason: I didn’t read enough. I don’t have time to learn from enriched inputs but have to tell with my limited vocabulary, which is desperately sad.

I decided to live in the U.S., at least for the next couple of years. But I can’t even write in English.

When I produced a paper, I feel like I am a technician but not a writer. No freedom, not sure about what I wrote down. Not sure what reader will receive.

You can’t win the audience just by having a good idea. It doesn’t mean you can survive if you follow a template/example precisely.

You need your own voice, own style, own mind.

Write as a fool.
